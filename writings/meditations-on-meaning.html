        <h3>Meditations on Meaning</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="sub">A World so Beautiful and Lovely</span><br>
            Today I watched the wind lift the last of the colourful autumn leaves, spiraling them into the air, it was so reminscient of confetti, like a 
            muted celebration of the mundane everyday, and I wondered how many times I've turned down the invitation to be as delighted as I felt in that 
            moment. I'd be lying if I said that it doesn't bother me that I've turned my back on instead of basking in the glory of seeing the greatness 
            in everything; I really had to completely restructure my ecology of the self, hack away at the parts of me so deeply institutionalized and prune
            away all the prosaic bits before I could even concieve of all this meaningfully. It does make me happy though that I've begun to understand well 
            enough to formulate an essay. I have no where near the linguistic dexterity to be able to fully capture and express the essence of the subject, 
            in the same way I imagine painters lament the beautiful details left unpainted, but I think that makes this all even better: the space from
            what is left unsaid can be later filled in by the context that you write for yourself, just as it had been for me. This very same advice was
            bequeathed to me by the people I love dearly. For a long while, I didn't understand it and let it collect dust, it's my hope you'll inherit it
            and never take its power for granted. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sub">Nothing Matters & Everything Does</span><br>
            I think that you really start to regard your life closely, eagerly, once you've understood that nothing really matters but at the same time, 
            everything does. You also become more gentle and playful and much less fragile when you become comfortable with straddling the chasm between nihilism and 
            a yearning for the grandiose. (see: Pixar's Soul) Instead, what transcends those things are the ordinary gifts of the day you've been given. The majesty of 
            the sunlight filtering through trees, a rabbit prancing through the bushes, a cup of tea made just the way you hoped, a phone call you've been meaning to make, 
            maybe a chance encounter. When you treasure all these casual things, truly, with a ferocity you once only reserved for  
            <br>
            <br>
            The magic of all this is that it's just one suspension of the ego away. (again, see Soul) When you reject the idea that your life is culminating towards a 
            grand purpose, the expected climax of the archetypical hero's journey, every moment that was once to you just a filler arc becomes worthy on its own merit. It's 
            no longer a space in the timeline disregarded because it was absent of association to some ultimate mission you're in pursuit of, but another beautiful piece inserted 
            carefully into your life's mosaic. At your life's end, your mosaic might be able to speak to your status in your absence if its only shards were your triumphs
            and dramas but it'd be a brutal and unmoving piece without the rest of the story. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="sub">Living in Abundance</span><br>
            Since I've begun to gently unfurl my capacity to treasure even the ephemeral specks in my day, I've noticed I've also been able to embrace variance and risk more closely, 
            shirk social norms more recklessly (just a bit of harmless mischief, nothing you'd be disappointed in me for!), and love more deeply. I look around me, at the natural world, 
            and I see infinite possibilities: I am so grateful to live in such abundance, and you do too! The currency you pay to revel in this all is only your attention, when you consciously 
            choose to pay that price day by day, you celebrate your existence and everything else's, today and forever.       
            <br>
            <br>
            tldr: blessed are those weaving the vibrant tapestry of life with gusto, for they shall inherit the earth.
