        <h3>Meditations on Meaning</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="sub">A World so Beautiful and Lovely</span><br>
            Today I watched the wind lift the last of the colourful autumn leaves, spiraling them into the air, it was so reminscient of confetti, like a 
            muted celebration of the mundane everyday, and I wondered how many times I've turned down the invitation to be as delighted as I felt in that 
            moment. It's a whole new world when you realize you have the agency to make yourself feel a little more alive at any given time: everything changes when you do. 
            There's an awesome, mesmorizing power to it, like wait, we can really just decide to feel uplifted in the most ordinary of things? Yeah, we always have been, we 
            just index way too much on the the dramas and the triumphs. You could live that way, allowing yourself only to feel rapture during the periodic crescendos and that's 
            just fine of course. But if you go out into the world and bless every interaction with a zeal that honours our mortality, earnestly and often, you live much better. 
            
            I'd lying if I said that it doesn't bother me that it took me a while to begin seeing the greatness in everything. Honestly, I used to be so divorced from the very 
            same ideals I'm writing about right now. I really had to completely restructure my ecology of the self, hack away at the parts of me so deeply institutionalized and 
            prune away all the jaded bits before I could even concieve of all this meaningfully, but I'm happy to be here, in this headspace, now. 
            <br>

            I want to preface this essay with a reminder about the dissonance between reality and the attempt to capture the essence of experiencing it. Depending on 
            how much context we share, a lot of this might resonate or maybe none of it will. If I had read this very same essay a year ago, I wouldn't be able to parse any 
            of it meaningfully. In the same way I imagine painters lament the beautiful details of their subject left unpainted, it does make me sad that I have no where near 
            the linguistic dexterity to be able to fully express all this. I'll just have to take comfort in knowing that the space from what I leave unsaid can be filled 
            in later by the context that you write for yourself.

            <span class="sub">To Live is to be Changed</span><br>
             Rejecting the idea that your life must culminate towards some grandiose purpose is the alchemy that turns every moment that was once merely filler to you, golden. 
             I've seen hundreds of night skies before, but when I looked up at a nightsky full of stars 4 months ago in Conneticut, I felt like I was born to be doing just that. 
             I've spoken to thousands of people before, but a lovely chat with an elderly subway musician about keeping the music alive made me feel more alive. I've
             hugged my family practically every day since I was born, but when I embraced them the last time I came home from university, I felt sure that moment was
             what I was made for. 
            <br>

            I think that you really start to regard your life closely, eagerly, once you understand the duality of nothing really mattering yet everything being meaningful. 
            You become more gentle and playful and much less fragile when you yearn for the entirety of the life you live.* That persistent ache of incompleteness, that consuming 
            fear of death taking us before amounting to something, these frailties dull because the ordinary gifts of the day transcend an elusive, ultimate purpose. The 
            beauty of sunlight filtering through trees, a rabbit prancing through the bushes, a cup of tea made just the way you hoped, a phone call you've been meaning to make, 
            or maybe a chance encounter, what's real and in front of us trumps seeking out some imaginary alternative. When you treasure all these casual things, truly, 
            with a ferocity you once only reserved for occasions you deemed worthy, you change and so does the outside world. Everything becomes a miracle. 
            <br>
            *Pixar does a really good job of illustrating this point about changing through story-telling. (see: Pixar's Soul - consider Joe's character progression)

            <span class="sub">Living in Abundance</span><br>
            Since I've begun to gently unfurl my capacity to treasure everything I can, I've noticed I've also been able to embrace variance and risk more closely, 
            shirk social norms more recklessly (just a bit of harmless mischief, nothing you'd be disappointed in me for!), and love more deeply. I look around me, at the natural world, 
            and I see infinite possibilities: I am so grateful to live in such abundance. The currency you pay to revel in this all is only your attention, when you consciously 
            choose to pay that price day by day, you celebrate your existence and everything else's, today and forever.       
            <br>
            <br>
            tl;dr blessed are those weaving the vibrant tapestry of life with gusto, for they shall inherit the earth.
